# REFERENCE FILES - DO NOT MODIFY

**PURPOSE:** These are snapshot copies of the main pages as they exist in their CORRECT, WORKING state after user revert on 2026-02-15.

**CRITICAL RULE FOR SOFTGEN:**
- These files are MASTER REFERENCES
- ALWAYS check these files BEFORE making any modifications to the actual pages
- NEVER overwrite content without explicit user approval
- If making changes, show DIFF against these references first

**Files in this directory:**
- `index.tsx.backup` - Homepage (correct state after revert)
- `schedule.tsx.backup` - Schedule page (correct state after revert)
- `coaches.tsx.backup` - Coaches page (correct state after revert)
- `coach-login.tsx.backup` - Coach login page (correct state after revert)

**Date Created:** 2026-02-15T00:06:10 UTC
**Reason:** Prevent accidental overwrites during sync trigger operations
